# Retail-Shenanigans
Retail project experience for Dr. Azimi
QODED Internship 2025 at the University of Arizona

Our aim with this project is to create a lightweight platform in which users can try items with a realistic depiction of themselves.
By leveraging existing AI tools and XR packages such as Meta’s SDK package for the Meta Quest 3, along with Avaturn’s AI software, which can produce human-like models, we hope to place users in an immersive environment where users can explore different clothing options and styles. We can then observe the benefits to consumer confidence and engagement due to the XR simulation. The additional ability to mirror the consumer’s own gestures sets this project apart in its ability to create a life-like experience for consumers. Our process includes using the biometric data of users through a few pictures of their face to create a realistic avatar of them, then by processing in blender, we add clothing, which is then ported to unity, in which users can try differing sets of clothing. Here, we can observe how their decisions are affected by the XR experience and the expressions of their avatar. In doing so, we can deduce the effect of VR on consumer decision making and confidence.
